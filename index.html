      <h2 >About Me</h2>
      <h5>Photo of me:</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:300px;"><img class="photo-g" src="iabur.jpg"></div>
      <p>I am Iabur Rahman, currently studying at East West University. I grew up in a small town in Dinajpur. There are many historical places in Dinajpur. I think the exposure to new places and new people can be really reviving personally and also eye-opening to see how other people live. To understand how life functions, whether human or natural life, in other places is humbling. It's easy to have your status quo at home, but as soon as you're in a new area - all bets are off. So I love to  let others know about my hometown.</p>

      <h2>Ramsagar</h2>
      <h5>Ramsagar (Bengali: রামসাগর), located in the village Tajpur in Dinajpur District, is the largest man made lake in Bangladesh.</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:400px;"><img class="img-pro" src="ramsagor.jpg"></div>
      <div>
      <p>Ramsagor is the biggest man made  water tank in Bangladesh, located at the village of Tejpur about 8 kilometers south of Dinajpur district. It can be approached from the town by a metaled road, which was once known as the ‘Murshidabad Sarak (road)’. The tank was named after Raja (king) Ram Nath who excavated it on the eve of the battle of PALASHI. At that time Alivardi Khan was the Nawab of Bengal. 
 
      The tank was excavated to supply drinking water to the people living in the surrounding villages. It is said that there was a continuous drought and famine in this part of the country from 1750 to 1755 AD. 
       Perhaps Ram Nath initiated to dig the tank on the basis of ‘food for work’ and help to survive the famine-stricken people. About 1.5 million labors worked for digging the Ramsagar and the total expense amounted is about 30,000 Taka.</p>

      <h2>Kantajew Temple</h2>
      <h5>Kantanagar Temple, commonly known as Kantaji Temple or Kantajew Temple (Bengali: কান্তজীউ মন্দির) at Kantanagar, is a late-medieval Hindu temple in Dinajpur, Bangladesh.</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:400px;"><img class = "img-pro"src ="kantojew.JPG"></div>
      <div>
     
      <p>The temple was built in a navaratna (nine-spired) style before the destruction caused by the earthquake of 1897. The characteristic features of the erections are the four centered and wide multi-cusped arches, the plastered surface of the walls having immense rectangular and square panelings, prominence of the central archway and the central mihirab by making the slightly larger and setting in a projected fronton in the outside directions, the use of ornamental turrets on the either side of the fronons, the semi-octagonal mirirab apertures,the archway opening under half-domes, the Persian muquarnas work in stucco inside the half-domes over the entrance arches and mihirab niches,the bulbous outline of the domes with constructed necks, domes on octagonal drums with lotus and kalasa finials as the crowning elements, the round pendentives to make up the phase of transition for the domes and the multi-faced corner towers rising high above the horizontal merloned parapets.</p>
